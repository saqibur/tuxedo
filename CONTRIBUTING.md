### For Smaller Projects: Git Feature Branch Workflow
In summary, before starting work:
1. Create a new issue, or assign an existing issue to yourself
1. Create a feature branch off `main` with an appropriate name describing your
new feature
1. After you've completed your feature, initiate a pull request and add a
reviewer
1. After the PR has been approved, squash merge your new feature to the `main`
branch. Ensure the commit message starts with `Merge PR: ...`.
