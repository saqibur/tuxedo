# Coding Guide
A set of coding guidelines for writing software... in any language.


## Keyword notes in code
Use TODOs, NOTEs and HACKs purposefully





### Punctuation, Spelling, and Grammar
Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to read well-written comments than badly written ones.

Comments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper capitalization and punctuation. In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than sentence fragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of code, can sometimes be less formal, but you should be consistent with your style.

Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that you are using a comma when you should be using a semicolon, it is very important that source code maintain a high level of clarity and readability. Proper punctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that goal.





3.10.2 Error Messages
Error messages (such as: message strings on exceptions like ValueError, or messages shown to the user) should follow three guidelines:

The message needs to precisely match the actual error condition.

Interpolated pieces need to always be clearly identifiable as such.

They should allow simple automated processing (e.g. grepping).

  Yes:
  if not 0 <= p <= 1:
    raise ValueError(f'Not a probability: {p!r}')

  try:
    os.rmdir(workdir)
  except OSError as error:
    logging.warning('Could not remove directory (reason: %r): %r',
                    error, workdir)
  No:
  if p < 0 or p > 1:  # PROBLEM: also false for float('nan')!
    raise ValueError(f'Not a probability: {p!r}')

  try:
    os.rmdir(workdir)
  except OSError:
    # PROBLEM: Message makes an assumption that might not be true:
    # Deletion might have failed for some other reason, misleading
    # whoever has to debug this.
    logging.warning('Directory already was deleted: %s', workdir)

  try:
    os.rmdir(workdir)
  except OSError:
    # PROBLEM: The message is harder to grep for than necessary, and
    # not universally non-confusing for all possible values of `workdir`.
    # Imagine someone calling a library function with such code
    # using a name such as workdir = 'deleted'. The warning would read:
    # "The deleted directory could not be deleted."
    logging.warning('The %s directory could not be deleted.', workdir)




Exception

Never use catch-all except: statements, or catch Exception or StandardError, unless you are

re-raising the exception, or
creating an isolation point in the program where exceptions are not propagated but are recorded and suppressed instead, such as protecting a thread from crashing by guarding its outermost block.
