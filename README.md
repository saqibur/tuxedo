# tuxedo
This is an opinionated Python style guide, derived from PEP-8 and personal
experiences.

Tuxedo serves hopes to achieve two main goals:
1. Writing a comprehensive style guide for my Python projects (the easy part)
1. Writing a linter that automates everything dictated in this style guide (the
hard part)


## Rationale
As this is meant to be referential material for myself, it contains proper
examples for every use-case.


## Philosophy
> "Simplicity over readability, readability over everything else"
