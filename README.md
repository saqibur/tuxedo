# Tuxedo
This is an opinionated style guide, derived from PEP-8 and personal experiences.

Tuxedo serves hopes to achieve to main goals:
1. Writing a comprehensive style guide for my Python projects
1. Writing a linter that automates everything dictated in this style guide


## Rationale
As this is meant to be referential material for myself, it contains proper
examples for every use-case.


## Philosophy
> "Simplicity over readability, readability over everything else"
